# Collaborative Writing Platform

Welcome to the Collaborative Writing Platform, a platform for writers to come together and create amazing content. This platform is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Features


- Real-time collaboration: multiple writers can work on the same document at the same time and see each other's changes in real-time
- Chat functionality: writers can communicate with each other using a built-in chat function
- Document management: writers can create, edit, and delete documents as well as organize them into folders
- User accounts: writers can create their own user accounts and manage their own profile and settings
- Versioning: writers can use GitHub-like versioning on their writing projects, allowing them to easily track and manage changes to their documents over time.
