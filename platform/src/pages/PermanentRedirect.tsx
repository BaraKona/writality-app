                <p className="mb-4">
                  Throughout the past few months development has been going on behind the scenes.
                  The vision for writality has been solidified and we're excited to share it with
                  you.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Writality is now a desktop app. This means that you can now write on your
                  computer, without the need to be on the internet. Additionally, we have revised
                  the design and added a few new features to make your writing experience even
                  better. Of course, the collaboration aspect of writing is still a big part of our
                  journey and we plan on incorporating it into the app in the future.
                </p>

                      Writing apps have been around for a long time. They're great, but they're not
                      always the best. We're here to change that.

                      Storyboarding is a great way to plan out your writing. It's a great way to
                      visualise your ideas and get a sense of what you're working towards.

                      In a world where everything is online, Writality aims to be offline first. Any
                      online aspects are optional and you can take it with your wherever you go.

                      always go back to a previous version.
